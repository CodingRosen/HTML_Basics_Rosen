HTML = Hypertext Markup Language
    #1 thing to know...HTML is NOT a programming language
        it is a Markup Language

Think of a teacher "marking up a paper" for grading
You don't execute markup language files but you provide the file to an application
    (e.g. Browser like Chrome, FireFox, IE,etc ) that can read it

index.html - just a file given to a Browser, the Browser then 
    renders (displays) the page to the user's screen

HTML - requires opening/closing  tags aka elements e.g. <p> </p>

id tag - attribute of an element that uniquely identifies it
class tag - attribute of an element that holds a classification for multilple elements
                (groups of the same elements)
id, class tags - used for CSS & JS, not much for HTML itself
